## Shopping List App

This was my project to help me and other people who shop with someone to better organize their shopping.

As the name suggests, this app offers the option to create a shopping list that will be shared through the internet (with the help of the [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) [API](https://sheety.co/)). For this app to work with Android, I used the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) library.

### This project is my idea, done by me in pursuit of learning Kivy.

### Known Issues:
- UrlRequest built into Kivy doesn't work with the PUT method (swapped with the ordinary [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library).
- The app has not been and cannot be converted into an Android APK.
